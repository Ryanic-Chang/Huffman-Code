The text you've provided touches on several interesting topics, including the history of understanding the sea floor, the challenges of weather prediction, and the role of determinants in mathematics. Let's break down the key points and address them one by one.

### 1. Understanding the Sea Floor
Before the investigation of the sea floor, people's imagination was limited to what they could observe directly from the surface. Here are the key points:

- **Surface Knowledge**: A hundred years ago, knowledge of the oceans was limited to the two-dimensional shape of the sea surface and the hazards of navigation presented by the irregularities in depth of shallow water near the land.
- **Early Discoveries**: Sir James Clark Ross obtained a sounding of over 2,400 fathoms in 1839, but it wasn't until deeper soundings and the use of dredging that more detailed information was gathered.
- **Challenger Expedition**: The H.M.S. Challenger expedition in the late 19th century was pivotal in establishing the study of the sea floor as a serious scientific endeavor. They found that many parts of the ocean were two to three miles deep, and the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude was confirmed.
- **Modern Understanding**: Today, we have enough data to create detailed relief maps of the Atlantic and understand the complex topography of the sea floor.

### 2. Weather Prediction and the Butterfly Effect
The text discusses why weather prediction beyond a few days is challenging:

- **Butterfly Effect**: Small errors in initial conditions can lead to large errors in predictions. This is often summarized by the "Butterfly Effect," which suggests that a small change (like a butterfly flapping its wings) can lead to large changes (like a tornado) in a complex system.
- **Modern Weather Models**: Current models use a grid of points about 60 miles apart, and even with perfect data, small errors can propagate and lead to significant inaccuracies.
- **Sensor Limitations**: Even if sensors were placed one foot apart and gave perfect readings, the complexity of the atmosphere means that small errors can still grow and affect predictions.

### 3. Determinants in Mathematics
The text provides a detailed explanation of determinants, including their properties and applications:

- **Definition and Notation**: Determinants are used to solve systems of linear equations and are defined only for square matrices.
- **2x2 Determinant**: The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated as \(ad - bc\).
- **Laplace Expansion**: For larger matrices, determinants can be expanded by minors, which involves breaking down the matrix into smaller submatrices.
- **Properties**: Determinants have several important properties, such as being multilinear, alternating, and invariant under row and column operations.

### Summary
- **Sea Floor**: People's understanding of the sea floor was limited to surface observations. Early explorations and expeditions, such as the Challenger expedition, provided crucial data to understand the complex topography of the ocean floor.
- **Weather Prediction**: The challenge of predicting weather beyond a few days is due to the "Butterfly Effect," where small errors in initial conditions can grow and lead to significant inaccuracies in predictions.
- **Determinants**: Determinants are mathematical tools used in linear algebra, with properties that make them useful for solving systems of equations and understanding the behavior of matrices.

These topics highlight the evolution of scientific understanding, the challenges in complex systems like weather, and the mathematical tools that help us analyze and predict these systems.
